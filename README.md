## About

I ship production-grade Android apps using **Jetpack Compose**, **Coroutines/Flow**, **Hilt**, and robust networking (Retrofit/**Cronet**) with a strong focus on performance, reliability, and analytics. I translate ambiguous product goals into **clean, testable code** and polished user journeys.

**Recent focus:** high-performance WebView tooling (client hints, JS bridge, safe file uploads), secure networking, and app hardening.

## Tech Focus

- **Android:** Kotlin, Java, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines/Flow, Hilt, Room/SQL, Retrofit, **Cronet**, WorkManager, Navigation
- **Architecture & Quality:** MVVM/MVI, Clean Architecture, modularization, feature flags, A/B testing, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), unit/UI testing
- **Data & Analytics:** Firebase (events, performance traces), crash/perf monitoring
- **Web & Tools:** **React** (incl. Next.js) for internal dashboards/companion tools, TypeScript, Node.js
- **Automation & Scripting:** Python for build tooling, data prep, and developer utilities

## How I Work

- **Performance first:** predictable rendering, lean memory usage, careful network I/O  
- **Maintainability:** small cohesive modules, clear boundaries, fast CI feedback  
- **Testability:** business logic drives UI; contracts and invariants are verified  
- **Security & privacy:** least-privilege defaults, safe storage, and network hygiene
